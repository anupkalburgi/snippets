we want to use a queue
and evey command will have a precondition to check
and in queue we want to store all the coommands that come in
for ever command we have a helper private func

when commit is called we execute all the commands in the queue and then mark the transaction complete
if a roll back is called, we will clear the queue and the mark the transaction complete
