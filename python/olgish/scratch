matrix symmetry
we have to access the elements of all the diagonals 
we need to find a group all the elements along diagonal

there are two ways to go about it, 
1. we observe that all the diagonal are along the 0th row or 0th column
    0,1
    0,2
    0,3

    and 

    0,0
    1,0
    2,0
    3,0

    so now we can have them as keys for the 

    for i,j in (0,1) to (0, endCol)
        i = i+1
        j = j+1
        we will have 
        0,1
        1,2
        2,3


2. the other way to go about it would be

def bfs(one, visited):
    q = [one] # (row, col)
    visited.append(one)
    size = 0
    while q:
        (nr, nc) = q.pop(0)
        for (nnr, nc) in neighbors(nr, nc):
            if (nnr,nnc) not in visited and gird[nnr][nnc] == 1: # we want do proceed only if that is land
                visited.add((nnr, nnc))
                q.append((nnr, nnc))
                size = size +1
    return size, visited

connected island
ones = [()]
visited = set()
max_size = 0
for one in ones:
    if one not in visited:
        size, visited = bfs(one, visited)
        max_size = max(size, max_size)
