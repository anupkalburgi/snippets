lexical ordering
can be done by converting the integers to string, 
and then sorting the string should give a lexical order 
that the time is going to be dominated by the sorting algo

now we can take that to a linear time, by using dfs
if we observe, for every number we are going from 0 to 9 adding one one to it=

we can do that using a dfs algorithm
